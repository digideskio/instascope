Mapping real-time Instagram photos and allowing users to search by a few different parameters: location + hashtags. 

Instascope geolocates Instagram photos taken around an area and plots them on the map. Users are able to view the Instagram photos in a thumbnail gallery and view details such as usernames, captions, and timestamps. Additionally, users have the ability to sign in to Instascope to like photos, follow users, or share them on Twitter & Facebook. Instascope has been designed to see what is going on anywhere in the world by interacting with the map search options on the app.

Instascope was built on Meteor.js using Google Maps Javascript API v3 and Instagram API. The app was built using Javascript in the back-end and front-end; also used Coffeescript, AJAX, HTML5, SCSS, Bootstrap, and MongoDB.
